Information regarding structure of code (2022-04-09):

Abaqus .inp file needs to be included in ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/main.
Job must be run from ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/src/main (as this is the dir in the
binary tree to which the .inp file is copied).
This is for example accomplished by executing run.sh (which travels into this
dir before executing the executable). It can also be accomplished by utilising
CMakeTools in VS Code. 

The modules and libs (not MKL) are added from its own specific directory in the source tree
by making use of the respective CMakeLists.txt file, see for example
${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/modules/whiskermodules/CMakeLists.txt.

In order to be able to use the Fortran Linter in VS Code, which utilises gfortran,
module files created by gfortran must be included in the path of VS Code
("fortran.includePaths" in settings.json).

Allowing lintering with gfortran as compiler:
Link to the module files in the binary dir.

Allowing lintering with intel as compiler:
Compile with gfortran (or linter in VS Code which uses gfortran)
and save mod files in special dir. Link to this dir in VS Code.  

Restraint: In order to make use of all utility in VS Code the fortran
program must be able to run with both gfortran and intel. Hence,
special intel statements must not be present.
