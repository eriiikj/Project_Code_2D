Information regarding structure of code (2022-03-28):

Abaqus .inp file needs to be included in ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/main.
Job must be run from ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/src/main (as this is the dir in the
binary tree to which the .inp file is copied).
This is for example accomplished by executing run.sh (which travels into this
dir before executing the executable). It can also be accomplished by utilising
CMakeTools in VS Code. 

The modules and libs (not MKL) are added in its own specific directory in the source tree
by making use of the respective CMakeLists.txt file, see for example
${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/modules/whiskermodules/CMakeLists.txt.

In order to be able to use the Fortran Linter in VS Code, which utilises gfortran,
the gfort_somelib folder must be inlcluded in VS Code (this is gfort compiled linter files).
Note that the compilation still uses intel as compiler.
